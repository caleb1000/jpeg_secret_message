This project is just me messing around with adding secret messages to jpegs. Currently the method is very simple.
After the end of the typical jpeg file a hidden encrypted message is added. This message is split up into
its individual bits, each bit now turned into a byte starting from least to most significant. Simply put, for every encoded byte, there will be
8 bytes added to the end of the jpeg. Finally, after you get the encoded message, to decrypt it simply use the LFSR algorithm with an inital
state of 0x12345678 and a feedback value of 0xDEADBEEF. These values can be changed, though please note to get the same
output as input you must use the same values.

To use this tool all you need to do is first run make. Two executable files will be made that allow for injecting
secret messages into jpegs and decrypting encoded messages in jpegs.

To added a secret message run the following command
./jpeg_secret_message <filename>.jpeg <Message>
Note: currently the output jpeg is named secret_message.jpeg. This will be changed to allow users to select a name.

To decode a secret message from a jpeg use the following 
./decode_secret_message <filename>.jpeg
