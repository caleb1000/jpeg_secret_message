This project is just me messing around with adding secret messages to jpegs. Currently the method is very simple.
After the end of the typical jpeg file I add 0xFF followed by an encrypted message. This message is split up into
its individual bits, starting from least to most significant. This can be easily undone by just adding consecutive 
8 bytes together until the end of the file. Simply put, for every encoded byte, there are 8 bytes added to the
end of the jpeg. Finally, after you get the encoded message, to decrypt it simply use the LFSR algorithm with an inital
state of 0x12345678 and a feedback value of 0xDEADBEEF. These values can be changed, though please note to get the same
output as input you must use the same values.
