This project is just me messing around with adding secret messages to jpegs. Currently the method is very simple.
After the end of the typical jpeg file a hidden encrypted message is added. This message is split up into
its individual bits, each bit now turned into a byte starting from least to most significant. Simply put, for every encoded byte, there will be
8 bytes added to the end of the jpeg. Finally, after you get the encoded message, to decrypt it simply use the LFSR algorithm with an inital
state of 0x12345678 and a feedback value of 0xDEADBEEF. These values can be changed, though please note to get the same
output as input you must use the same values.
